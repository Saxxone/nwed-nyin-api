The Anaang are the second largest ethnic group after the Ibibios in Akwa Ibom state.[3]

The Anaang were formerly located in the former Abak and Ikot Ekpene Divisions of the Anaang Province, as well as part of the former Opobo Division of Uyo Province, in the former Eastern Region of Nigeria. The proper name for the Ika of Akwa Ibom is Ika-Annang.[4]


## History

### Ancient origin
The predominant paternal haplogroup among the Anaang is E1b1a1-M2.[5] The ancestors of the Anaang originally came from Northeast Africa and moved around the Green Sahara.[6] The gradual movement of the Proto Anaang to the Cross River Region may have been associated with the expansion of Sahel agriculture in the African Neolithic period, following the desiccation of the Sahara in c. 3500 BCE.[7]
